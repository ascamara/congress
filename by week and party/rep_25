must decentralize power serious debates issues national importance well especially crucial failure pass meaningful reforms help perpetuate direct violations americans rights cannot allow continue
congress continues squander opportunities genuinely legislate giving power leadership avoiding difficult debates votes dysfunction prevents productively addressing national concerns feeds peoples polarization anger
better real debate theres widespread public support serious reforms find compromise deliberate proceed meticulously lets vote individual bills bill end qualified immunity lets freely consider amendments
saying reforms must house bill fact cramming many things one bill house leaders support one giant bill yet proposal sidesteps key issues cant fix policing without examining policed
need fewer criminal laws period
house bill also fails grapple overcriminalization key source problems trying address cant fix issues law enforcement without ending overreliance policing criminal justice system broadly implement public policy
legislation senate republicans also focuses mostly changes states already ignoring key federal reforms federalism concern least interested fixing federal practices undermine state policies
bill doesnt even address federal practices undermine states efforts eliminate civil asset forfeiture incentivizes cops initiate interactions public take property people havent even charged crime
bill includes many statelevel reforms could done without federal government yet overlooks important changes federal government make fully ending transfers equipment department defense police
also elaborated problems confusion surrounding thirty-five journalism today faster ever speed come devaluing accuracy coverage recent vote illustrates problem quite well read headlines prominent mainstream outlets antilynching bill passed house late february
bill also includes thirty-five increases penalties various crimes falsely presenting bill ban lynchingwhich already federal hate crime fact thirty-five simply references existing laws detailed 35s many problems clear bill make lynching new federal hate crime murdering someone account race conspiring legal federal law already federal crime already hate crime
say department justice role play reforming policing obviously terrible idea put bill barr charge designing enforcing rules police america operate
bill tasks department justice designing guidance regulations implement many policing reforms dojregardless white houseis part brutal disastrous criminal justice system
specifically reforms structured conditions department justice grants available state city receiving grant uses money increase overall law enforcement funding replace state local funding
problem compounded fact bills reforms state local law enforcement vast majority policing happens required state city willing accept federal dollars increase spending law enforcement
bill provides money police prosecutors may undermine local efforts change role policing communities aclu calls nonstarter noting role police smaller circumscribed less funded taxpayer dollars
bill reforms doesnt end qualified immunity fact implicitly endorses officials including prison guards suggests congress supports immunizing officials abusing rightscontrary congresss intent passing civil rights act one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-one
