still thats link
revised bill
like read congress get text legislation pretty sure article constitution vests legislative powers congress steven mnuchin swamp action deal cut masters universe hill told must vote mere hours minutes
congress shouldnt wait individuals cut deals back room supposed deliberative body discovers best outcomes debate amendment constantly sidelining representativesleft right otherwiseis recipe hyperpartisanship
congress still bill system totally dysfunctional legislature supposed legislate fully support six thousand, two hundred and one families first coronavirus response act voted house evening bill follow direction free coronavirus tests paid sick leave impacted american workers directed

nope
different draft rejected administration
saying voted lynching law doesnt make youre simply highlighting another example dysfunction system read bill journalism today faster ever speed come devaluing accuracy coverage recent vote illustrates problem quite well read headlines prominent mainstream outlets antilynching bill passed house late february
independent kind partisan thinking got donald trump
house fair amount back look legislative history tax law people constantly conflate senate process house process speaker ryan almost always terrible process tax law hardly best example
thats
twoandahalf hours later still bill read congress still bill system totally dysfunctional legislature supposed legislate
get wholly endorsed bill doesnt even exist still drafted
many people rightly denounce trumps abuses power perfectly happy give pelosi pass circumvents entire legislative process congress even seen bill think whether imagine good bad point
sitting please read bill appeared journalism today faster ever speed come devaluing accuracy coverage recent vote illustrates problem quite well read headlines prominent mainstream outlets antilynching bill passed house late february
reply say authoritarian regimes
thats bill thats summary one drafts
youre misunderstanding wall street getting another break
house leaders gave less thirty minutes review revised bill staff reviewed prior drafts worked quickly compare one hundred and ten pages upon review clear couldnt responsibly vote bill key provisions appeared unworkable drafted
sorry missed cant keep every reply rely mnuchin pointing indirectly confirmed said last night leave requirement partial reimbursement apply small mediumsized businesses
paid leave requirements apply businesses especially large ones
three months paid leave already exempt requirements
ill give examples without time confer drafters others couldnt determine businesses five hundred employees exempt paid emergency leave fmla requirements improper wall street carveout justification
worries understand frustration work constructive conversations also wish colleagues strength bias groupthink unfortunate aspects human nature
read bill see instead worrying whos side maybe worry text legislation
thanks least day right wrong senate back monday
paid bill work big company
mean like one last week
youre ignoring point agree senate shouldnt rush seem fine houses rushing even though know senate considering bill monday whats harm giving least saturday review carefully
kidding rightly pointed last night big companies improperly exempted pay emergency leave big companies getting special favor government employees get fewer protections
bill companies five hundred employees mysteriously required provide paid emergency leave paid fmla special carveout big businesses
senate would come back house wouldnt count
house three days review final text tax bill
entire legislative process unacceptable especially important issue senate returning monday reason house leaders rush passage bill midnight without giving time confer deliberate voted present
sorry tell bill suffered similar problem people didnt read every major outlet got wrong journalism today faster ever speed come devaluing accuracy coverage recent vote illustrates problem quite well read headlines prominent mainstream outlets antilynching bill passed house late february
let read bills speaker pelosi please explain bill passed house saturday require big companies provide paid sick leave employees
common refrain youre confusing house senate dont condone senate house three days review final text tax bill three days far cry thirty minutes
course years criticisms gop politics usual dont like vote tax bill understand hate break one annual spending bill contributes way way deficit year tax bill

note two things mnuchin said press conference paid leave applies small mediumsized businesses exempt wall street companies bill errors needs technical correction words doesnt work drafted stated house leaders gave less thirty minutes review revised bill staff reviewed prior drafts worked quickly compare one hundred and ten pages upon review clear couldnt responsibly vote bill key provisions appeared unworkable drafted
dont know answer everyone transparent public whats going
government partly reimburses via tax credit businesses new emergency paid leave requirements big companies exempt requirements reimbursements short burden placed small mediumsized businesses
problem think lot people confused
appear confusing voted yes house vote rushed imply given three days review final text house

bill exempts requirement
mainly people companies fifty four hundred and ninety-nine employees
bill allows secretary labor exempt businesses fewer fifty employees paid emergency leave fmla requirements unclear implemented unlikely work casebycase basis despite text businesses
dont know next bill
paid fmla bill big companies mysteriously exempt though
someone ahem pointed last night others might noticed vote wed given thirty minutes review final bill harp process bad process yields bad substance bill house passed last night guarantees paid coronavirus sick leave twenty percent american workers repeat workers still arent guaranteed paid sick leave
vote expected early one thousand, two hundred and twenty reading fast final text received one thousand, one hundred and fifty-seven one hundred and ten pages vote expected within hour
didnt vote trump open two thousand and sixteen two thousand and eighteen running office republican cant abandon rule law trump daily pelosi secretly crafted bill gave house almost time review
businesses fewer five hundred employees government supposed reimburse portion paid emergency leave fmla however reimbursement form delayed tax credit means businesses may become insolvent economic downturn
could even know theyd write way didnt let see time made available already calling vote
matter came theyre bad theyre bad besides gop asks thats reason speaker given time deliberatean opportunity explain public problems provisions
talking new sickleave bill giant holes employers five hundred employees exempted
theyre delivered pdfs presumption wrong generally members congress access big legislation intentionally kept dark true republicans gives leadership lot power control drafts sometimes leaked
want big companies get subsidies also provide paid emergency leave paid fmla small mediumsized businesses required
okay hes jerk speaker use time available craft best thoroughly vetted legislation
final text received one thousand, one hundred and fifty-seven one hundred and ten pages vote expected within hour
