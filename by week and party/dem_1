congress also deep interest future relationship iraq given investment blood treasure rid region isis congress needs understand administrations plan soon possible
admin like others right act selfdefense administration must come congress immediately consult military engagement going protracted informed assessment would consider administration must request aumf
critical administration thought moves countermoves attack precipitate prepared protect diplomats service members citizens serving overseas
diplomats service members highranking military officers allies partners region targeted attacks western world
two administrations worked determined ultimate ends didnt justify means trump administration made different calculation iranian government vowed retaliate avenge soleimanis death could number ways
always kept democratic republican presidents targeting soleimani simple question strike worth likely retaliation potential pull protracted conflict
watched power increased brought strength capability groups iraq syria lebanon yemen smaller cells around middle east world devastating consequences
watched friends colleagues get hurt killed iranian rockets mortars explosive devices provided iraqi proxies used forces soleimanis guidance
worked middle east past twenty years dealt growing organization sophistication soleimanis covert overt military activities contributed significant destabilization across region
former shia militia analyst served multiple tours iraq worked white house presidents bush obama later pentagon participated countless conversations respond qassem soleimanis violent campaigns across region
repslotkin learned ground iraq president trump made rethink views america conduct abroad
second reason stay ironically reason president chose qasim soleimani counterbalance irans destabilizing influence middle east
agreement allowed send roughly five thousand forces support counterisis operations train iraqi military sundays vote baghdad gave political cover kick neither necessary binding
said expect issue taken iraqi cabinet week real possibility follow formally ask removal forces
matters first foremost presence iraq helps ensure isis doesnt regenerate regain ability threaten united states europe middle east
forces withdrew iraq two thousand and eleven took isis two short years gain power mosul raqqa two isis power centers selfproclaimed caliphate finally liberated two thousand and seventeen
united states kicked gives iranian government freer hand iraq thats freer hand exert influence iraqi decisionmaking
soleimani architect strategy going back two thousand and four built idea forces attacked iraq casualties would eventually force united states withdraw
two thousand and fourteen iraq quickly negotiated terms force presence exchange letters remains agreement books authorizes military personnel iraq represented pentagon negotiations
immediately clear isis dangerous wellfunded global reach could soon would organize inspire attacks west
invested heavily shia militia groups iraq would teach target forces ironically death may achieve precisely set life
freer hand continue expand capabilities shia militias irans placement ballistic missiles iraq project violence places like saudi arabia israel last issue could game changer
question many americans likely asking matter kicked iraq certainly understand many would question wed want stay given blood treasure invested part world
indeed get officially asked leave iraq need robust diplomacy outline plan iraqi government maximizes pressure isis allows time safely withdraw way doesnt cost blood treasure
time withdrawn forces iraq two thousand and eleven united states uniformed military presence performing independent military missions iraq large embassy carrying regular diplomacy
watched iraqi parliament respond sunday killing qasim soleimani passing resolution rejecting military presence iraq thoughts implications
bit context two thousand and fourteen isis took large swaths iraq syria desperate government iraq formally asked military help fighting isis
president team remember gravity responsibilities prepared explain strategic plan include next steps possible ways deescalate owe american public less
repslotkin unfortunately feels like classic case cycle escalation iran
repslotkin idea iran wants peace safety region sorry factually correct said imagine country equivalent four star general killed would certainly pressure respond
withdraw iraq wake soleimanis killing thats soleimani wanted life hope get death
nothing prepares sound incoming fire tonight watching coverage thinking service members diplomats harms way families back home worried
