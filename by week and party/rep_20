yall want hear song summer amashforamerica
didnt say otherwise dont perfect knowledge local knowledge important fighting virus virology important understanding virus mutually exclusive governors consistently dismiss first kind knowledge
okay ask scientist favorite food time day like grocery shopping path take aisles many friends might bump store
relevant millions people take individual actions every day informationnot aggregate rather individual basisis available scientists anywhere business owner knowledge keeping customers safe scientist could

former county communitybased rules also believe state local governments engage individuals businesses adopt efficient effective measures better incorporate local knowledge
looking presidential candidate seventy profree trade immigration drug war fisa war war favor lower spending lower taxes check 5term congressman
stop forcing counties follow rules fighting virus effectively requires bottomup approach utilizes viral science local knowledge circumstances counties work cooperatively businesses adopt best approach
sounds like youre making political point scientific one fact serious problems donald trump doesnt mean local knowledge dismissed complements scientific knowledge critical effectively tackling virus
yes
correct precisely pointing need viral science local knowledge circumstances effectively fight virus state governments shown disdain latter kind knowledge
warrantless government surveillance needs end candidate stop amashforamerica
position epidemiologists know specific actions individual community cant really believe
scientist may know viruss characteristics doesnt know communitys characteristics feel eat shop work operate businesses items constitute useful kind knowledgeavailable locally crucial limiting viruss spread
person saying need belief scientists governors impose blanket rules society misguided dangerous dont important knowledge
setting requirement knowledge assumption reflects bias pointing need viral science local knowledge circumstances effectively fight virus state governments shown disdain latter kind knowledge
first tweet precise referring actions individuals people aggregate scientist knowledgebecause one person obtain micro interactions make difference limiting spread virus
appreciate thoughtful reply hayeks insights dont apply field economics talking simply studying observing spread virus youre right scientists largely equipped tackle problem
governors advised scientists set rules cant readily observe rules impact behavior theyre focused aggregates real life individual actions ability know rules affect actions particular stores real time
clear donald trumps department justice arguing better protection americans rights fisa court bill still bad administration wants worse doj happy amended version fisa reauthorization passed senate today
