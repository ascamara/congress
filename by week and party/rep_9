federalizing crime also creates possibility person may charged state court federal court essentially crimea form double jeopardy due process violation
invite problems criminalizing conspiracies federal law activities largely deal statelevel issues
hr35 criminalizes conspiracies violate various federal criminal laws including many unrelated lynching already illegal conspire commit federal crime acts bill covers already criminal
bills main effect make conspiracies punishable extent greater underlying crimes punishable death abolish death penalty expand crimes
youre saying cant believe congress outlawing lynching theres good reason cant believe true clear bill make lynching new federal hate crime murdering someone account race conspiring legal federal law already federal crime already hate crime
even concerning bill framed protection people color yet rights people color disproportionately violated massive unaccountable criminal justice system
creating federal crimes matters normally handled state obscures governmentfederal stateis responsible investigating prosecuting crime gives power unelected federal officials voters cant directly hold accountable
clear bill make lynching new federal hate crime murdering someone account race conspiring legal federal law already federal crime already hate crime
allows state officials dont adequately address particular crimes shift blame avoid accountability time creates incentive budgetconstrained state local governments prosecute crimes instead leave feds
setting aside bill doesnt create new criminality conspiracies bill cover many crimes constitution leaves states federal government
federalization criminal law serious unintended consequences put everyones rights risk
undermines states experimentation different approaches criminal justice uses resources available actual federal issues encourages expansion federal police force nearly accountable people local police
constitution lets congress criminalize enumerated activities federal nexus crimes left states framers recognized dangers federalizing criminal law especially threat individual rights
motive confused intent element criminality voted hate crime bill regarding unborn children prolife voted hate crime bill regarding police
sophia unless point roll call vote amash listed yeas tweeted false misleading retracted

youre misunderstanding specific acts bill including lynching already crimes federal law suggesting lynching already illegal simply murder generically already illegal
animal crime bill youre referencing
thats correct noted voice votes occur without actual consent happen without notice without members floor vote may aware dont know else making wrong assertions replying respect
