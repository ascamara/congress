fixes include giving businesses flexibility use funds change new models help adapt survive means allowing greater latitude apply funds without penalty staffing also essential items functions
capping ppp banks decide businesses get funds congress white house created system businesses strong banking connections getting easier access funds businesses shut
yes congress voted last bill proposed several alternatives including universal monthly cash relief people
paycheck protection program unfairly left millions small businesses cold need rectify ppp wont fixed adding money program major flaws need addressed right away
without fixes program many small businesses continue benefit ppp well talking ongoing failings program coming weeks
ppp needs money money wont enough without substantial fixes program
businesses arent favored banks less likely access loans outside ppp means businessesthe ones trouble getting ppp fundsmay ones need access
also would stop program continuing penalize small businesses find theyre unable rehire employees newly enhanced unemployment insurance benefits pandemic bigger workers paychecks would

heres said previous legislation recent coronavirus law may help americans find temporary relief slow wholly insufficient riddled bad incentives unintended consequences law exacerbate prolong devastating economic decline harm millions people
enhanced benefits creating disincentive return work causing tension ppp time many people desperately need help arent getting ineligible relief programs onetime one thousand, two hundred check isnt cutting
voted yes last bill created administrative mess exacerbated inequities denial ppp access many small businessesand todays vote must send message businesses dont deserve fairness issue must addressed
leaders dumped laps surprise bill adds funds ppp without fixing problems within ppp within broader relief package inexcusable double flawed approach continues fail people represent
voted last months two trillion coronavirus bill among many failures bill denied assistance millions people todays bill corrects inequity adding funds ppp doesnt fix structural flaws made last bill unfair ineffective
last bill implemented predicted problems emerged layoffs still planned companies getting targeted bailouts ppps complex rules limit usefulness many businesses program favors businesses may less need government support
heres proposed alternative congressional leaders wasting time slow convoluted proposals americans need fast direct relief start getting monthly checks people
weve weeks work solutions issues couldve done house senate leadership allowed members work debate todays bill instead ignored members asked ways deliberate remotely negotiated bill

yall want hear song summer amashforamerica
didnt say otherwise dont perfect knowledge local knowledge important fighting virus virology important understanding virus mutually exclusive governors consistently dismiss first kind knowledge
okay ask scientist favorite food time day like grocery shopping path take aisles many friends might bump store
relevant millions people take individual actions every day informationnot aggregate rather individual basisis available scientists anywhere business owner knowledge keeping customers safe scientist could
example business owner know manage traffic specific grocery store much better governor advised scientist lansing cant account particular circumstances blanket rule may cause huge line door helps spread virus

saying reforms must house bill fact cramming many things one bill house leaders support one giant bill yet proposal sidesteps key issues cant fix policing without examining policed
need fewer criminal laws period
house bill also fails grapple overcriminalization key source problems trying address cant fix issues law enforcement without ending overreliance policing criminal justice system broadly implement public policy
legislation senate republicans also focuses mostly changes states already ignoring key federal reforms federalism concern least interested fixing federal practices undermine state policies
bill doesnt even address federal practices undermine states efforts eliminate civil asset forfeiture incentivizes cops initiate interactions public take property people havent even charged crime
bill includes many statelevel reforms could done without federal government yet overlooks important changes federal government make fully ending transfers equipment department defense police

united states kicked gives iranian government freer hand iraq thats freer hand exert influence iraqi decisionmaking
soleimani architect strategy going back two thousand and four built idea forces attacked iraq casualties would eventually force united states withdraw
two thousand and fourteen iraq quickly negotiated terms force presence exchange letters remains agreement books authorizes military personnel iraq represented pentagon negotiations
immediately clear isis dangerous wellfunded global reach could soon would organize inspire attacks west
invested heavily shia militia groups iraq would teach target forces ironically death may achieve precisely set life
freer hand continue expand capabilities shia militias irans placement ballistic missiles iraq project violence places like saudi arabia israel last issue could game changer
question many americans likely asking matter kicked iraq certainly understand many would question wed want stay given blood treasure invested part world

withdraw iraq wake soleimanis killing thats soleimani wanted life hope get death
nothing prepares sound incoming fire tonight watching coverage thinking service members diplomats harms way families back home worried
